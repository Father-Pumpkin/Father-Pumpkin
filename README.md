- Hi, I’m Mitchel Smith, and I develop under the tag @Father-Pumpkin
- I’m interested in applications of game design techniques to education to make learning more fun!
- I’m currently a Computer Science Master's student and University of North Carolina Charlotte with a concentration in AI, Robotics, and Game Design.
- School keeps me quite busy, but I like to make time for personal projects. I am currently partnering with James Smith developing a database for use with research of children's books in the Madrid Library System. I also like to develop games during my free time.
